# ice_analysis
Cosima Cookbook scripts for analysis of ACCESS-OM2 sea ice.

Run `getfigs.sh` to download a local copy of all figure files from `/g/data/v45/aek156/notebooks/github/aekiss/ice_analysis/figs`.
You can then do `latex ice_analysis_slides.tex` to create the summary `ice_analysis_slides.pdf`.

The members of the perturbation ensemble are defined in https://github.com/aekiss/ensemble/blob/1deg_param_ensemble/ensemble.yaml
